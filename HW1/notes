Two types of synchronization:

-Mutual exclusion // Guarantees that only onne process at a time accesses a shared resource, ie only process at a time has access to a variable
-Conditional sync // 


The Await Statement
Wait for (B) to be true, then execute S atomically
Combines cond sync with mut ex
B is guaranteed to hold when S begins
S is guarantees to terminate

need to unlock B (critical reference).
thread that needs to change B, needs to signal. (if not locks).

//google true dependence
//google anti dependence
//output/input dependence

memory should behave like atomic registers. (because of read read)?
