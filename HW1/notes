Two types of synchronization:

-Mutual exclusion // Guarantees that only onne process at a time accesses a shared resource, ie only process at a time has access to a variable
-Conditional sync // 


The Await Statement
Wait for (B) to be true, then execute S atomically
Combines cond sync with mut ex
B is guaranteed to hold when S begins
S is guarantees to terminate

need to unlock B (critical reference).
thread that needs to change B, needs to signal. (if not locks).

memory should behave like atomic registers. (because of read read)?

co i = 0 to n-1
	if (a[i] > m)
		<if(a[i] > m) m = a[i];>
oc

Lesson Learned,
Synchronization is required whenever processes read and write shared variables
(to preserve true, anti, and output dependences).
Mutex to help reach atomiicity.

var x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
co
	x= x +1;
	y = y + 2;
	z = x + y;
	<await (x > 1) x = 0; y = 0; z = 0;>
oc

possible to get y = 4, because of no syncronization
since, y = y + 2 statement isnt atomic, y can be reset in memory after being read from memory
z can be any value between 0 and 6 because of same reasons

Assertional reasoning

; <--- means sequential execution.
S1; S2;
S1 is executed before S2

mutex i and i++;
mutex max min;

Ammount of locks has a tradeoff, several locks can endup in deadlock.
Very few locks can end up in decreased parallellization <- hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

//google spin locks
types of spinlocks
	unfair locks:
		fast as fucboi
		unfair as fucboi
		good in low contention ie small number of competing processes

	fifi lock:
		first in first out, fairly cheap i think or something

	spin lock:
		give someone passage, and spin the "queue"
		should be used in low contention because of how it works on a software&hardware level

	test&set lock:
		on a hardware level it is similar to spinlock, but you have them daisy chained?

critical section solved by hardware design:
	added atomic instructions for read write
